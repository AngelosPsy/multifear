## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
Fixed the paired sample t-test in the t_test_mf function that caused
the test to fail. 

Updated the code so that it reflects changes in the tidyverse package


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.5.0
* ubuntu (devel and release on github actions)
* win-builder (devel, previous major release, and release)

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note
