Thanks to Uwe Ligges for checking the package. 
* I removed the URL from the NEWS.md file -- it was not necessary.
       
* This was a minor change so I did not changee the release number (it stayed at 0.1.1). I hope this does not cause any problems.

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.3
* ubuntu 20.04 (release and devel, on github actions)
* macOS-latest (release)
* win-builder (devel on github actions)

## R CMD check results
