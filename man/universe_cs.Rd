\value{
A tibble with the following column names:
x: the name of the independent variable (e.g., cs)
y: the name of the dependent variable as this defined in the \code{dv} argument
exclusion: see \code{exclusion} argument
model: the model that was run (e.g., t-test)
controls: ignore this column for this test
method: the method used
p.value: the reported p-value
effect.size: the reported effect size
estimate: the estimate of the test run
statistic: the value of the test
conf.low: the lower confidence interval for the estimate
conf.high: the higher confidence interval for the estimate
framework: were the data analysed within a NHST or Bayesian framework?
data_used: a list with the data used for the specific test
}
\description{
Basic function for running a multiverse analysis for a single data set
}
\details{
\lifecycle{experimental}

In case of higher order interaction, only the highest order
effect is shown.

In case the CSs include only 1 observation per participant, or of enequal numbers of CS trials, the
function will return the warning ""Skipping ANOVA due to the number of trials for the cs1 and/or
cs2."".
