\arguments{
\item{cs1}{The column name(s) of the conditioned responses for the first conditioned stimulus}

\item{cs2}{The column name(s) of the conditioned responses for the second conditioned stimulus}

\item{data}{A data frame containing with all the relevant columns}

\item{subj}{The name of the column including the participant numbers. Unique numbers are expected.}

\item{time}{should time be included? Default to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{group}{the name of the group, if included, default to \code{NULL}.}

\item{phase}{The conditioned phase that the analyses refer to. Accepted values are  \code{acquisition},  or \code{acq}, \code{extinction}, or \code{ext}.}

\item{dv}{name of the measured conditioned response. Default to \code{"SCR"}.}

\item{exclusion}{If any exclusion criteria were applied, default to \code{full data}}

\item{cut_off}{cut off}

\item{multicore}{The option to run the analysis in multiple cores, not available under Windows.
Default to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following column names:
x: the name of the independent variable (e.g., cs)
y: the name of the dependent variable as this defined in the \code{dv} argument
exclusion: see \code{exclusion} argument
model: the model that was run (e.g., t-test)
controls: ignore this column for this test
method: the model that was run
p.value: irrelevant here
effect.size: irrelevant here
effect.size.ma: irrelevant here
effect.size.lci: irrelevant here
effect.size.hci: irrelevant here
estimate: the estimate of the test run
statistic: the t-value
conf.low: the lower confidence interval for the estimate
conf.high: the higher confidence interval for the estimate
framework: were the data analysed within a NHST or Bayesian framework?
data_used: a list with the data used for the specific test
}
\description{
Basic function for running the Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA

\lifecycle{experimental}
}
\details{
In case the \code{time} argument is set to true, the function will
include this as a within subjects factor, assuming that the columns in
\code{cs1} and \code{cs2} corrrespond to ascending time points (e.g., cs1
trial 1, cs1 trial 2 ... cs1 trial \code{n}). If this is not the case, the
results are not to be trusted.

The ANOVA will run *all* possible models and combinations. Please note that
in case of many factors, this will mean that the analysis will take a long
time to be completed.

\examples{
# Briefly define argument values that will be plugged in later on in the functions.
# We only use two trials as the function takes a long time to run.

cs1 <- paste0("CSP", 1:2)
cs2 <- paste0("CSM", 1:2)
subj <- "id"

# Repeated measures ANOVA
