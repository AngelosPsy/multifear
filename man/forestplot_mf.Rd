\description{
Basic function for forest plot
}
\details{
\lifecycle{experimental}

This is a wrapper around the \code{forestplot::forestplot} function.
The function only uses the ANOVAs and the t-tests. For the t-tests though
it includes only the two-sided, as they are the same with the one-sided ones
and having both would probably give a false picture of the effect.
